# Moodboard Generator - Pinterest API Integration Request

## Application Overview

**Moodboard Generator** is an AI-powered web application that creates personalized aesthetic moodboards based on uploaded clothing images. Using advanced computer vision and machine learning, our platform identifies fashion aesthetics and curates visually cohesive moodboards from high-quality lifestyle photography.

### Core Value Proposition
- **AI-Driven Aesthetic Recognition**: CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) model classifies uploaded clothing into 90+ fashion aesthetics
- **Intelligent Curation**: Automatically generates moodboards with complementary lifestyle images, venues, and accessories
- **Professional Quality**: Sources high-resolution images from curated content APIs for professional-grade results

## Technical Architecture

### Current Technology Stack
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python) with asynchronous processing
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript for responsive user interface
- **AI/ML**: Hugging Face CLIP model (RN50) for image classification and similarity matching
- **Caching**: Redis for performance optimization and rate limit management
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for user authentication and moodboard storage
- **Authentication**: JWT-based user authentication with secure password hashing
- **APIs**: Unsplash API (primary), Pexels API (secondary) for content sourcing

### Data Processing Pipeline
1. **Image Upload**: User uploads clothing image via drag-and-drop interface
2. **AI Classification**: CLIP model analyzes image against comprehensive aesthetic vocabulary (91+ terms)
3. **Keyword Expansion**: Top aesthetics mapped to relevant search terms via curated configuration
4. **Content Fetching**: Parallel API calls to gather candidate images (30+ per moodboard)
5. **Visual Re-ranking**: CLIP similarity scoring ensures visual cohesion with original upload
6. **Moodboard Assembly**: Final selection of 15 images arranged in responsive grid layout
7. **User Authentication**: Optional user accounts for saving and managing moodboards
8. **Moodboard Storage**: Saved moodboards stored with original image in center position

### Performance Metrics
- **Processing Time**: Sub-5 second moodboard generation
- **Classification Accuracy**: 75%+ user agreement with AI aesthetic detection
- **API Efficiency**: Aggressive caching maintains <20 API calls per unique moodboard
- **Cache Hit Rate**: 80%+ for repeated aesthetic queries
